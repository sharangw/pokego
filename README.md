# pokego

## Project
* The goal of this project was to create a web application using data from the RESTful Pokemon API located here: https://pokeapi.co/
* This application was part of my training program at Revature.

## Tools
* Pokego is a single page application written in JavaScript, AJAX, and jQuery for sending requests to the API along with HTML and Bootstrap for front end needs. It is hosted on GitHub Pages. 

## The Game
* Pokego presents users the opportunity to battle two pokemons of their choice where the victor is determined through a combination of statistics such as base experience, total base stats, and an element of randomness.
* The game is available to play here: https://sharangwakankar.me/pokego/
